The dress was casual enough for a daytime, outdoor ceremony, but also dressy enough for the party. The material is heavy and elegant - I received compliments all day long! I have bigger hips and was still able to size down due to the full skirt. I would recommend that instead of sizing up where you may be inadvertently showing more side boob than you might want!

I have an athletic body, longer torso, shorter legs. \n\nRE: FIT\/STRETCH. Because there is no stretch it this at all, this fits true to size. So, if you are a 4\/6 girl (like me), order the 6. Whereas, if you're a 4\/6 girl and you've been watching those sweets for a couple weeks, then you'll be able to wear the 4.  I ordered both!  I was worried I wouldn't be able to sit in this, but I was able to sit just fine, in both the 4 and 6.  I was \"worried\" that the sleeves wouldn't fit my arms (I do back\/bi and chest\/tri every week), yet the sleeves were fit perfectly!\n\nRE: LENGTH\/SEXINESS. I felt that the dress was appropriately long. By today's trends, most gals would say it's way too long. And in fact, it would probably be too long for a petite woman. However, for my Bridal Shower, it really made a lovely statement, by being sexy (with it's illusion top and glittery \"burnt\" rose gold) without being too sexy (appropriate length, covered chest).  From the pictures, you can tell that I am very, very, very pale. The illusion netting was a different color from my skin, but I didn't mind one bit. If that's a concern of yours, you can always wear panty hose to match. \n\nRE: ACCESSORIES: I wore dainty drop pink pearl earrings and matching bracelet and my engagement ring.

In order to play “Preacher’s Wife” I feel like I had to step up my game.\n\nAfter dressing like a disgruntled office worker to the first wedding I attended as an adult, I’ve spent years attempting to undo this mistake with mostly vintage dresses or rewearing the same few Dillard's jams over and over, desperately trying to style them into something fresh. Enter RTR and this lil beauty.\n\nPROS: GORGEOUS detail. Lace for days. Great length for a formal affair where you don’t want to show your lady business. Beautiful open back and delicate chest detail. Love the two pintucks on the front. Also really fun to style—it’s somewhat conservative on the body but took really kindly to punk and vintage styling. Tons of compliments! Looks pretty with pearls as well. AWESOME to dance in. Both top and bottom parts of the dress let you move without anything falling out.\n  \nCONS: I’m gifted in the booty department, so I was a little bummed to not have a more defined bum. The waist was defining but not as dramatic as I would have liked. I also have a smaller chest and found that I needed to wear a bra just to add some oomph to the top. The lace also may snag on a friend’s dangly earrings or a purse chain, so watch out! \n\nHMM: There’s a bustier \/ inlay whose inner clasp was broken when it arrived, but I was able to make it work without it!\n\nI’m still giving this thing a 5\/5 because I loved my RTR experience and I see this dress in my dreams. We already miss each other. Come back to me, Shoshanna dress. ",

So I would not recommend to someone trying to hide the belly.

There is built in wiring\/lining in the waist and bust. \nCustomer service was extremely helpful.

While it was very form fitting throughout, it did fit true to size, although  I recommend going up a size in your back up - especially if you have fuller hips. I chose to not wear a bra with this gown because of the open back, but you could definitely use a seamless adhesive bra or silicone coverups for extra comfort and concealment.

        "review_text":"Overall, I loved this dress and I thought it flattered me very well.  But there were a couple of small things that made the dress a strange fit.  \n1. The bust area is extremely loose.  It is simply two flaps that cross over each other so if you're not a full D cup (I'm a size 12-14 and am a 36 C) the flaps will sag open and you will show your undergarments.  I had to safety pin the front in two places so that it would stay close and unfortunately was self-conscious about it throughout the night (especially while dancing).\n2. Because of the way the dress is designed, the hem is uneven if the bust is not filled out.  If the front starts to sag (which it did for me) it causes the whole dress to shift longer in the front and pulls up the back.  Being 5'10, I specifically rented a dress that was long on some shorter girls.  However, because the dress kept shifting to the front, I had to continually pull the dress down in the back because it kept riding up and getting shorter and shorter.\n3. The material is surprisingly clingy and if you are fuller on bottom, it shows every line.  I would recommend a body shaper that allows a smooth line all the way from the waist to the thigh area (a leotard shape that just sucks in your tummy will cause a significant panty line).\n\nThe dress is stunning and flattering to curvy figures.  It just needs some adjustments to make it the perfect fit.",

The dress is on the shorter side but wasn't a problem for me (at 5'1\" it hit me a couple inches above the knee) but I could see it being an issue if I was taller. The back is the best part! It's a little peek-a-boo without being too much AND since the cut out is higher on the back, a bra can easily be worn. I wore a strapless but after the fact I realized I could have worn a regular bra and it would have been fine... oh well!

As you can see, the 10L was actually a little short. The 12L was EVEN SHORTER, ;like 4 inches shorter (bizarre). I'm not all that tall. About 5'7\" in bare feet. My heels brought me up to about 5'11\" and the 10L still didn't graze the ground (the 12L was UNWEARABLY short! Seriously, I almost wish I'd gotten the XL). \n\nI was very happy with how this dress hugged my curves. I have a very true hourglass figure, with just a bit of a tummy. This draping on this dress concealed EVERYTHING! I'm not kidding! It also helped with my \"less than perfect\" arms. \n\nThis dress has a good amount of stretch. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the amount of layers. The pictures don't really showcase that the bottom has three layers: one stops right at your bum (so be careful if you are bottom heavy -- it will cut into you), the second helps show less leg behind the slit, and the top lies as you would expect. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this dress. It was very comfortable and it didn't feel too heavy. I am big busted (36DD-36DDD) and I was able to wear a Spanx singlet and a normal bra. \n\nOverall, I would definitely re-rent this dress for a different occasion.

I had ordered an 8L and a 10L. I am only 5’7 but I usually wear at least a three inch heel with no platform. I ended up wearing the 10L even though I typically wear an 8, because the 10 hung better. I was unimpressed with the fabric, which I felt detracted from the quality of the dress. It was a slinky mesh material, so you could see every bump underneath it. I didn’t wear any undergarments because of that. I didn’t feel the dress was overly flattering on my body type. I have a wide rib cage, broad shoulders, big chest, and small waist. Despite how uncomfortable I felt in the dress or how I felt it looked on me, I received more compliments on that dress than I have ever before on any purchase.  I had men coming up to me saying the dress was stunning. The auctioneer referred to me as the “stunning lady in red” after I won a bid. Women approached me to tell me how gorgeous I looked. One woman said I looked like Anjelica Huston and another said Jessica Rabbit. Bottom line is the dress was a show stopper and very glamourous. It is also very comfortable to wear. ",

The dress is comfortable, and the color is pretty and bright without being obnoxious. As another user mentioned, you will want a racerback bra (or no bra if you can), as the front of the dress cuts in a bit and the sides of my bra sometimes peeked through.

The pros are exactly how beautiful it is, that it is really warm for winter, and it has an overall very flattering fit. It is rather short by the way, so dark thighs may be a necessity. It has some cons though. The first one is that it has a weird fit in the arms. The opening between shoulder and arm is rather large, but then the fabric compresses the arm itself. So, it accommodates a thicker arm around the shoulder, but not at the biceps area. This was annoying, and I felt pretty uncomfortable wearing it because of that. Two other cons, which are no big deal: the sleeves are really long. It's ok for wearing it standing up, but if you need your hands at all you will have to bring the sleeves up, which is not very easy to do with this dress, and also loses part of  its charm. The second is that the dress is warm indeed, so you will feel hot if you are either walking a lot, dancing or just being at a warm enough venue. One thing which may interest some: I was 6 months pregnant when I wore it, and it does not compress the belly at all. I was quite comfortable there in spite of the bump, my discomfort was all because of the arms. ",

With the one shoulder look on this gown, I would suggest going with a strapless bra.  The natural waist is definitely very fitted, but it did allow comfortable room throughout the midsection.  I would suggest sizing up for fuller hips as that area is definitely quite fitted.  The one shoulder sleeve was definitely a bit tight on my broader shoulders, so that's definitely something to keep in mind.  At 5'7\"  this hit right at the bottom of the floor without heels so I would definitely suggest a long length for women my height or taller.

The boning ends just at your natural waist and was pretty uncomfortable so after a long night of dancing I ended up with a scab on my hip where the boning rubbed.

I wore a short slip to eliminate friction between my Spanx and the dress lining so the dress wouldn't ride up around the hips.  I was disappointed to find that my backup size was not available but it probably would have been too big in the bust area anyway even though the extra hip room  may have eliminated the need for the slip.

Some dresses make you work to wear them, but this dress isn't! It's like wearing that comfy sweater - where you don't have to worry about bra straps sticking out, sheer material for an oops moment, too long trails, etc - but you still get to look fabulous. \n\nFor sizing, I think I could have even gone down one size as my waist is more petite, and that area is the most fitted area of the dress.

I could not get the extra fabric on the side to hang right, even after attempting to steam out the wrinkles. Also, I did not realize the slit in the chest was so low....not really work appropriate. However, the rest of the dress, style-wise, was too conservative for a night out or a date, in my opinion, so I was left wondering where I'd really be able to wear it.

The jumpsuit was true to size; however, the it was a little long so, heel height is key or fashion tape for the hem. The material also wrinkled easily which was a con for me. Overall this jumpsuit fits better than most and the material is most similar to crepe so, it did not add warmth, but kept me warmer than I would have been if I opted to wear a dress.

I could have gone with either; I just preferred to have the top fitted so that the layer under the lace wouldn't dip too low. I ended up wearing a strapless bra with this (the back is high enough that it's covered), but I also probably could have gone without one.

I called RTR (in a panic), and they had the dress (in both the original and back-up sizes) overnighted to my hotel for no extra charge.

I have a 34D cup-size and this usually creates a problem in the chest but it didn't at all. I will say I didn't realize how low the chest line dips, you definitely cannot wear a bra. Because I have a big chest there was a lot of cleavage (I rarely wear anything with cleavage) but the lace tones it down. I wore to a gala and it was perfect made a statement without being to showy.

The small fit a little snugger but I found it highlighted my midsection a little more than the medium did, so I went with the medium. My one issue was that it is a really heavy dress because of the sequins, and it did get a little hot after wearing it all night but I didn't find the sequins to be too itchy or irritating.  I would definitely recommend renting this! ",

On the hanger it doesn't look like anything special, but when you put it on it comes alive- especially if you have curves!! The lace was thick, well constructed, and sewn onto the solid lining so it doesn't shift. AMAZING. The darker color and lace overlay hide body flaws pretty well, but I did pair it with Spanx to smooth everything out. I wore it with an adhesive bra as well to not have to deal with a traditional strapless (straps would be visible through the lace). If you are petite and\/or pear shaped like me this is a great choice since the shift style does not have a defined waistline and there was plenty of room in the hips. I'm still in the process of losing the remaining baby weight and this dress was very forgiving while still looking sharp.",

The dress is a true sheath so although it does not do much for the shape of the body, it lends itself well to over-indulging in food and drink and dancing for 3 hours straight. I ordered both the 12 and the 14 and wore the 12. I would size down for a backup since I didn't even need to try the 14 on and I typically fall between the 2 sizes. Was very stylish while easy going, the beading was beautiful although there were a few small sections where the beadwork had been damaged it was not noticeable from a distance. The beadwork makes the dress kind of heavy but for a late fall wedding in Florida I was comfortable both inside and outside at the venue. I received more compliments on this dress than on anything else I have worn. The dress is whiter than I was anticipating, so I would suggest nude undergarments. You can easily wear a standard bra with this dress though which helped in the comfort and dancing ability. I ended up wearing metallic gold sandals with the dress that worked well. I would suggest gold or black based on the beadwork. The dress is such a showstopper alone that I just paired it with my everyday jewelry and small studs and it went over beautifully. Would definitely rent again\/buy if that option becomes available. At 5'9\" the dress was a nice length for church and dancing especially with flats.

I mean that wasn't really a problem because by then it just looked like a pretty train because of the way it fell with the slit in the middle, but please keep that in mind when considering this dress. The fabric also held up SO NICELY.

They go ALL out for this event (5000 people, tons of food from around the world, and a live band). I was nervous to be over or under dressed, and I wanted to be elegant, flirty, yet professional. This dressed nailed all three and calmed my nerves the minute we got to our pre-party. Couldn't be a better dress for a holiday party. Received many compliments! The fuller length adds class, while the low neckline gave me a fun amount of cleavage without me popping out. (I'm a smaller cup size - 34B, and with no bra, I felt secure and supported in the size SR dress!)\n\nOther positives: easy to dance in, doesn't drag on the floor like many full length dresses, flattering to my curves, sat on the hips nicely without bunching up fabric or squeezing my thighs. \n(I just wish my nude pumps didn't have a broken heel plate because black shoes were cute, but nude would have better haha.)\nCon: no pockets..? haha just kidding - not really a con.

Things to bear in mind: keep a good posture (shoulders back) to ensure the gold part at the top doesn’t look buckled in the front. You'll want to keep it laying flat against your chest for good photos!  Others had mentioned that the arm holes were a little tight and I agree (I had a little redness by the end of the night where they had rubbed against my skin but it was totally worth putting up with for the glamour of the dress).  The zipper was very stiff and I doubt I could have zipped it all the way up without assistance.

I had no difficulty with the strapless bra staying hidden. You do have to put this dress on over your head and there is a size zipper that I was afraid I wouldn't be able to zip up all the way; however, I have historically had issues with my rib cage apparently being broader than average (or something). There is no give or stretch built in to this dress.

If I hadn't had black tights on, some folks might have seen my underwear when sitting. The pockets on the side were great but it also made the bottom half of the dress balloon out.

I received compliments all night long; this dress is definitely one of a kind. It runs small in the chest area (and I have no chest), so I had to go with the size up from what I usually wear. The regular length is perfect for  someone of average height (I am 5'6\") with a small heel. However, the train did get in my way throughout the night, especially when dancing, as it got caught in my heel several times. But it was worth the annoyance to wear such a stunning dress!!",

The dress itself was great and hugged in all the right places. The material was a slightly heavy which is great it you have any unflattering areas. Downside is it runs very small. Since this was a rushed overnight dress, I was only given the option of 1 size so I went with what I normally wear. There is absolutely no give in the dress. A size up would have been perfect.

        "review_text":"Gorgeous dress! It was my first time renting and RTR is totally awesome. The fit is fantastic but it does run large, so I recommend sizing down. I ordered a 0L and 2L (normally a 2 and I'm 5'9).  The fit of the 0 was perfect but it was about 2\" too short in front but the train hit the floor. The 2 was very large and there was a lot of room in the chest even though I am fairly busty (30E) which isn't ideal for a strapless dress. However, it was super long! I ended up wearing the 2L (for the length but consequently I was pulling it up all night, I should have just stuck with the smaller size and wore flats) and 5'1\/2\" heels to eat up some length but there was still about 3\" - 4\" of train on the floor. The difference in length the between the two dresses was astonishing. The fit wasn't nearly as tight and flattering in the 2 but oh my the 0 looked so good! Maybe it's better suited for someone a littler shorter who doesn't have a problem with the length of dresses. Also, the fabric is a nice, thick material with the right amount of weight to flow beautifully. Either way it was still fantastic and I would definitely recommend it! ",

I wore this one on the \"more formal\" of the two evenings as the lace lent a nice elegance to the dress. Although it was a shorter dress, it worked for the formal night and allowed me to dance without stepping all over a long gown. My only complaint was that the torso, which was quite fitted, creeped up repeatedly as I danced, being that my arms were raised to shoulder height. Assuming most people wouldn't be in a dance frame all night, this wouldn't be an issue!! I have a larger chest\/ribcage, and the 10 fit very well, not too snug at all. In the 8, the sleeves were too tight for my arms as it is lace (not really any give) and they come to the elbow. The dress was otherwise quite comfortable and breathed quite well for being fully lined. And the pockets are ALWAYS a bonus for me in a dress.",

The lace on the neck and back isn't lined, so it got very itchy and I kind of felt like the neck was choking me. The skirt has a very stiff hem that gives it its poofy shape, but that made it hard to sit close to people in the church, my skirt took up space for another person on either side of me. I ended up changing between the ceremony and reception because I didn't think I could be comfortable dancing in this dress.  The red lace also felt a bit too \"holiday\" for me, not really appropriate for an August wedding.\n\nI got the 4 and 6, the 4 was a little tight around the waist but the 6 was too baggy on the chest area. Good thing I decided to go with the 4, the hem on the 6 was ripped and the stiff stuff that gives the skirt its shape was sticking out. ",

I did have to pull it up a bit throughout the night and it was long when worn with flat sandals. Overall I was very happy with the color and look of this dress and would recommend to anyone who has a person available to help zip them into and out of it. ",

Normally I wear a size 8 but I found that the 6 fit more comfortably and was more flattering.  I also don't have a large chest so the 8 had too much fabric in the chest and would have fallen and revealed my bra every time I moved.  Both zippers were a bit sticky but with my husband's help, we got them up.  On shorter women, expect this dress to hit around the knee, still pretty, but I think with all these sequins you'd be going for a sexier look.",

She was the maid of honor, so the fact that her dress was different actually worked out. Another bridesmaid who wore a 10L couldn't wear heels otherweise the dress would have looked to short on her, so she wore flats Maybe the dress we recieved was not truly a long.

Sequins weren't scratchy and gave the dress enough structure so that it was slightly forgiving in the midsection. Only con is that the hem is a bit fitted, making it difficult to pull the bottom down over the thighs, resulting in a bit of wiggling in the ladies room (I didn't want the sequins to catch on my hose). I received lots of compliments and the dress is all over sequins without looking like a disco ball. Would definitely recommend. ",

I loved the ease of this dress; just slip it on and add some statement jewelry and you are ready to head out the door.  The material is soft and doesn't wrinkle even after driving an hour in the car.  My only regret is that I ordered a 2 and a 4.  The dress is not very fitted in the waist.  I wish I could have ordered the 0 and the 2 just to see if the 0 fit closer.  The 2 ended up being great though because I could move comfortably in it and required no special undergarments.  Overall, this is a stunning dress.  My boyfriend wanted to buy it for me so I never had to give it back! Get ready to stand-out in a sea of little black dresses this season and take their breath away!",

The cut was insanely flattering and it added a WOW factor to even my most mundane looks. The jacket is made out of a thick, stretchy, material. Because it is stark white, it does show every bit of dust and dirt. In other words, don't turn your head too far right or left if you're wearing make-up and want a clean collar.

I loved that the material was thick enough that the dress didn't need a slip\/liner...they create too much static cling in the winter when worn with tights, but not too thick that it couldn't be worn in fall\/spring as well.  And those pockets... they are awesome and the dress still manages to be sleek despite them.

Other than that, I really enjoyed weraing the dress and was able to dance all night without feeling exposed or having to constantly tug and pull on it.

The ruching hides quite a bit and the fabric is nice and thick, so you can get away without Spanx. I was truly sad to take this off at the end of the night and stuff it into the return bag. Btw, it's actually pretty easy on\/off; just step into and out of it. The only thing is that the sleeves tend to travel on your shoulders.

It was nice\/snug fitting on the top. The bottoms had a little more space.  Jumpsuits are usually questionable from the backside and I thought this one fit better than most.  It was not tight, but did not give you that droopy but look either.  I did cuff the bottom of the pants so it fit at a desired length since I am only 5'4\".

I would not have worn this around family or colleagues. The straps are long and that makes the front even lower; if I'd owned the dress, I could have shortened the strap and it would have been more tasteful, but obviously that's not possible with a rental. A bit of the lining on one side of the bust kept rolling over and showing slightly over the edge, which wasn't a big deal but it wasn't perfect.

This dress is extremely versatile because if you bring a sweater with you, the sweater can cover all the non-conservative parts of the dress and instantly turn the dress into something very conservative.  Might consider sizing down if you are small-busted and on the fence between sizes, because if this dress is too loose for you on top, you might have to constantly fidget with the top.

The material is a bit on the stiffer side, so it will make your hips and butt stick out a bit more than they usually would. The dress has pockets, which is awesome.

Many of the sequins, especially on the top half, had been worn down and were bright silver instead of dark navy, making the dress look uneven and cheap in person. Comparing the dress in the two sizes I ordered made it very clear that this is NOT how the dress is designed; it is a result of too much wear and tear. Luckily the silver just made it look like the light was always catching the dress in the same place when I wore this to an evening event, so I wore it anyway since I didn't have a plan b and the fit was very flattering. The top, however, runs quite large and I had to tape it to myself in about 8 places to keep the straps from falling down, even in my smaller back up size. I will say this dress is very flattering, but I hope RTR will do stricter quality control in the future and take the more heavily worn dresses out of its inventory. Overall I would recommend this dress assuming the dingy one I received was the exception and not the rule.

The drop-back was the most flattering part, so ladies - wear your hair up or to the side with this dress! Also, this dress makes a statement all on its own, so the less jewelry, the better. I went with one sparkly ring and tinted gold cubic zirconia studs. \n\nThis was my first time using RTR and I would HIGHLY recommend this for ladies who want to stun, but don't want to invest on adding another dress to their closet.

I wore the sticky cups to have a little more support, but it would also be okay without. I especially like that the back strap has two options for how tight you can make it.

It seemed like RTR knew about this and sent it anyway because the dress had a piece of blue tape on it and a red piece of paper stapled around the arm. I removed those and did a quick fix in order to wear it that night.

The outfit comes tighter in the stomach and then had form fitting pants - this helped give me a bit of a butt, since I have none. I also have small boobs, making the shoulder straps a little loose - but not to the point of falling off the shoulders. It felt great under the armpits. Also, the V neck cut wasn't too low in the front or back to wear a bra with the outfit. Lastly, threw on a little shaw to give it a pop of color. Hope this helps - happy renting!",

        "review_text":"First off, the shipping. I received the dress two days before my scheduled event date (which made me super happy) so that was great. We were a bit skeptical about RTR at first, since it's an online rental service, but everything came through smoothly!! The first size I ordered was a 4R... which was a mistake. I thought to myself \"Well, high end brands have smaller numbers than not high ends brands, so I may be a 4...\" WRONG. COMPLETELY. AND UTTERLY. WRONG. Thank goodness I ordered a 6P as a back up. And I HIGHLY recommend ordering a backup; you never know, you may need it. Also, while the dress fit nicely, I still had a bit of a problem keeping the dress up. It was just a slight problem though, my bra fell more often than my dress did, if that tells you anything. I believe it falls a bit because it's rather heavy and has so many sequins, but don't let that keep you from getting this dress. It's a slight annoyance, but TOTALLY worth it. It is seriously the only con, but that comes with just about every strapless dress out there. Secondly, despite what the page says, I HIGHLY recommend ordering a petite size if you are shorter than 5'5. I am 5'3, and the petite was barely short enough to keep from getting caught on my 4 inch heels. Also, as for jewelry (if you are thinking about renting jewelry... I didn't, but here is just some advice) brassy golds don't go very well with this dress, instead, go for lighter colored golds. I have also noticed that diamond gold earring tie everything jewelry-wise together, so I recommend getting your hands on some of those. ANYWAYS, this dress was absolutely wonderful and Rent the Runway is probably the best deal you can get out there.",

I would not recommend this dress for someone with no curves. The size 6 was okay, but a little loose in the armpit and hip. The 4 fit like a glove. The zipper did get stuck, and I couldn't get the dress off after initially trying it on, and the zipper bowled out from the bottom (which turned out to be a major catastrophe). I called RTR in a panic. They couldn't send me another one in time, but they were very active in trying to help me find a new dress and told me I could come to their \"off limits\" Soho location and pick anything in my size at no cost. They were really trying to help-which I appreciated, but I just couldn't get my mind off this dress! I insisted on wearing it-even if I wore the bigger size. At last, the mgr megan offered to have a local seamstress replace the zipper at no cost to me. I was SO relieved to see that the zipper was replaced in under 3 hours on the DAY of my event and that I was going to be able to wear it after all! It turns out that the manager credited me for the whole thing b\/c a tooth on the zipper track was bent, and it was what caused the problem. They felt bad for the inconvenience and made up for it-which is exactly the great kind of customer service I was looking for! *If you ever have a problem-just ask for a manager right away (I had tried a few customer service girls a few times before I found one who knew what to do-which was annoying) but thank you to Megan and Talia for using their heads!\nThis dress was actually very comfortable to sit in for long periods. The dress would've been too long, but I wore a 5 1\/2 inch heel with it. (So if you're petite and don't like huge heels, get the petite size.) The fabric loosens up after wearing it a few hours.

I'm only 5'3\", so I wanted a dress that I could shorten with hem tape.  I ordered the tape with my gown and it did the trick beautifully!  I have a large chest, so I purchased the Braza strapless backless bra and it worked perfectly.

It was also that '70s era polyester type material and was duller and more peachy than the picture. I could barely squeeze it over my hips and it showed EVERYTHING (I could see my belly button), but you can't wear any \"slim-wear\" because of the open back. It's also very short, but I do have long legs. The perfect body for this is under 5'5\", no hips and no fat on your stomach. If that's not you, then size up, maybe twice... Or rethink your selection. The skirt on this, though... I was a little iffy because it was cape-like, but it was actually so beautiful in person!",

I thought that was kind of strange, but not a deal breaker. I ended up wearing the larger size since it was warmer out than I was anticipating and the liner on this is pretty solid so I wanted a bit more breathing room.

I'm not even sure what my current size is.  I was unsure what size to order, so I went with an 8L and a 10L as a back-up.  After reading the reviews from the red and black dress that matched this style dress (since this dress didn't have any reviews yet), I decided to go with the long instead of the regular.  Once I received the dresses and tried them on, I realize they were just too long.  I was going to have to wear 6 inch + heels and I didn't want to do that.  Also, the 8 was too tight in the rib cage and the 10 was too big in the bust.  I contacted RTR and requested to have an 8R overnighted to me.  I also watched what I ate the day before my event, hoping that would be enough to make the 8 a little more comfortable around the waist\/rib cage.  Luckily, it worked!  The 8R was perfect!  I wore 3 inch heels with the regular length and the dress nicely skimmed the floor without being too long.  Just for reference, the tightest part of this dress is right at the highest part of the waist just at the rib cage\/just below the bust and the measurement at my rib cage right now is 31.5 inches.  The 8R gave me a tight fit but was not uncomfortable.  The 10 was a little too big for that measurement, especially since I couldn't fill out the bust.  There is no stretch in this fabric so keep that in mind when ordering.  The pockets were a huge plus!!!

It does take some maneuvering to get into though... but once you are in with the right pair of tights... awesome.",

I was frantic looking for a dress at the last minute in April (Prom Season) and was not really sold on this dress. I rented a second style with this order. I did not like the way the other dress fit and when I tried on the size 0R, it fit me like a glove!! I felt extremely sexy and elegant at the same time. The top of the 0R was a little worn and the boning started to dig into my chest as the night went on. The bottom flows so nicely and it is an extremely light dress. I am so proud to be wearing this dress in all the pictures and videos that were taken. I also liked that the sleeves fell more off my shoulders than what the model shows. LOVE THIS DRESS!",

My only complaint on the dress (and it could have been a fluke?) was that the seams through the waist and bust were a bit itchy.

This dress runs true to size, and we suggest sizing up for backup due to being fitted throughout the midsection.  The fabric also has no stretch.  Although fitted, I felt that the halter neckline with keyhole detailing looked very flattering for my bust size.  Since I'm 5'1\",  it fell about 3-4 inches on the floor, so my fellow petite ladies will need hem tape for this one.  Pair this dress with simple studs to complete your look!",

Because of its shape, you don't need anything special--no Spanx, no nothing. I wore a strapless bra, but you could get away with wearing a regular bra.

The cut was rather boxy however, making the overall fit feel a bit large.  In fact, it looked a little awkward when buttoned ... BUT, in the \"pro\" column, if you're my size and trying to conceal a 6, 7, or 8 months pregnant belly then this blazer will certainly do it for ya!  Knowing that, I would still rent again (and plan on it) because I typically don't wear my blazers buttoned in the front anyway.  Overall, excellent quality and good fit with limitations.",

The length was perfect, the pockets were fun and the quality is fine. Here's the \"missing star\"... So, I wore this at a black tie event on Halloween weekend... and EVERYONE that commented on my dress mentioned that I looked \"just like a Disney princess!\" ugh. Honesty, that WAS the first thought I had when I put it on, but I didn't like my backup dress, so I had to wear this one. With the off-the-shoulder sleeve caps, fitted waist and full skirt, it is _very_ princess-y. Which might work for some people. But not for a 42 year old woman at a very fancy business event! Oh well.... \n\nOn a side note, the dress was HORRIBLY wrinkled when it arrived. So bad that I started a chat with a stylist to see what to do. After nearly an hour of back and forth, they offered to reimburse me to have it professionally dry cleaned at the hotel. The hotel dry cleaner wasn't able to get it turned around quickly enough, so they graciously brought me a steamer from the hotel boutique! (Five stars for the hotel!!) It took me 30 minutes to get all the wrinkles out, which was stressful while trying to get ready in time. I think the new \"garment bag\" shipping (rather than the garment boxes RTR used to ship in) don't work for dresses like this one. It was just crushed. :(",

Sitting makes the bagginess even worse. However, despite the strange bagginess, it was still strangely tight on the shoulders when driving, typing, reaching, etc. The back panel is not nearly as sheer as I thought it would be based on the pictures. It looks like it was a mistake instead of intentional. However, it did make my body look amazing when standing, and it is a cute dress.

I will say that I probably could have easily worn a 2 as well considering how stretchy the fabric is. NOTE that the back is open and dips low and has a stretchy string that zig zags across your back and gives it a modern look (the lowest point of the open back almost went to my panty line but i have a short mid-section).

Oddly enough even with a full bust the straps on top where to big....fashion tape was a must. \n\n2. If you've got a full bust...you've got to love the ladies to where this gown. Be prepared to show a little flesh. \n\n3. Get the long if you resemble anything near 5' 5\" and\/ or if you have curves. I originally purchased the regular then went back and read the reviews again and called to have it switched...best decision ever...given the heels I was wearing (approx 2.5\") the regular would have been too short.\n\nOverall, fantastic dress easy to dance and move in and a show stopper...highly recommend!

The 4 fit better in the body (I am small in the ribs and have wider hips) but the sleeves were too tight on my arms so I ended up wearing the 6, which fit pretty well also.  I think the dress was new and may not have been previously worn so the sleeves were still very tight and rigid.  I didn't end up wearing a bra (more because I was running late and had already gotten my arms into the sleeves) but definitely could have worn a strapless or stick-ons (def had the room) but braless was fine too.  I almost wasn't able to wear this dress because of the tight sleeves in both sizes but it worked out okay and they loosened up a bit throughout the night so I would just take that into consideration if thinking about renting it.  Otherwise, it's a great dress and I received a lot of compliments.  Not as shimmery as in the model pictures but fantastic pattern.  One last note, I didn't wear Spanx because the underneath material of the dress kept getting twisted due to the friction between materials as I moved and then all of the dress lines were off.  This also ended up being fine as well since there is a texture to the dress and the lines give you a great defined, flattering waistline.  More comfortable without the Spanx anyway!",

It's way out of any price range I'd ever considered for a rental, but I absolutely loved it, and will be buying it when RTR is ready to sell. It was perfect for my office Christmas party this year...a little more substantial fabric, so I was warm enough, festive green color, and special without being inappropriate. I'm used to other women gushing, so that happening all night was no surprise, but I received multiple VERY appreciative compliments from the men all night as well. \nAs far as the fit... I'm a little taller, so sometimes it's difficult to find dresses in a decent length, but this one was perfect. I guess you could say the fit is a little bit loose, but it's so well tailored that I thought it was perfect. Such a fun change not to have to tug, yank, and smooth all night long! I was able to wear a normal bra, which is always a plus. The fabric was heavier, with a very pleasant give to it - since it was not skin tight, I did not see any need for Spanx or shapewear - nothing negative showed. I loved that this dress was still flattering even though I have a smaller bust...I'm barely a B, but I thought this dress looked amazing. The great thing about this dress is that I believe it would compliment a wide range of bust sizes...there was plenty room for more, but it did not gape or look too big on me.\nThanks RTR!!

I'm not much of a jewelry person so I loved that I didn't have to worry about it. I'd definitely recommend this gown! It's stunning and received a ton of compliments!! ",

I received a number of compliments and I felt very confident.  I was kind of prepared for the peril of the big top after reading ALL previous reviews on this dress.  It did come with fashion tape, which I used all of it and a safety pin or two helped. I am a 34D so the top was not extremely baggy like some reviews, it just needed some tweaking so that I wouldn't flash other guests.  I wore a strapless bra, which in hindsight wish I had gotten a deep plunge bra with straps.  Just a preference...why wear strapless when I didn't have to?  I'm 5'6\", the 4L was perfect. I've been wearing a 6 lately in my work clothes so I ordered a 6L as an alternate but the 4 was perfect. The band around the waist is not stretchy, so when zipping the back, that is the area where you need to tug a bit to get the zipper the rest of the way up. I wore 3.5 inch heels and the bottom swept the floor nicely.\nAlso rented the Alex Bittar Serpentine Cuff and the Lilly Pulitzer Elephant Clutch.  LOVED BOTH.\nAlso, I live in Louisiana but the event was in Virginia.  Given the 4 day rental window, I had the items shipped to my parents' house in VA, it arrived on Thursday as expected. Since mail doesn't run on Sunday, I shipped it out on Monday when I got back to La.  Easy peasy. My first time using RTR.  I will most DEFINITELY be back.

One sister is tall athletic, one is short and thin\/straight & narrow (neither of them have much bust), and my older sister is curvy with a large busy.  The ruffles on this dress hid the wrong curves and hugged the right ones. It made both the athletic and thin sister look a little more curvy\/busty, and the curvy\/busty sister look a little more thin\/refined. They all looked absolutely amazing. Awesome dress.",

The top runs true to size but maybe size up if you have broader shoulders. Because it's off the shoulder, the neckline can be kind of fussy, sometimes riding up. This can also be worn for a more formal or professional look, pairing it with a nice skirt or pants.",

The dress is versatile for a host of events. \n-Most friends raved over the pockets and when I told them about RTR, they looked it up on their iphones then and there.\n-Other renters have commented about the dress' shortness. On a petite person, it was a great length but it does ride high when seated, as renters have reported. I had a pashmina with me and draped it across my lap during the meal so nothing showed.\n-I admit, I was sad to pack it up for return this morning but am excited to rent another dress for an occasion next month.

The 2R felt perfect around my midsection but the top sagged to the point where I kept having to push the shoulder up every few minutes. I also had to employ the use of a LOT of double sided tape and proper undergarments (ahem, Spanx). \nBra worn: Strapless corset-type bra by Betsey Johnson. Purchased at Nordstrom and I fully recommend it! It lifted like a dream and was super comfortable to wear. A traditional strapless would work but I didn't feel it was flattering with how loose the dress is in the bust.\nOther notes: Tape the hanger straps down into the dress.

First - the 10L was barely long enough wearing flats (I'm 5'7\"). The 14L was a little loose, but overall, it fit better and I was comfortable and didn't need any shape wear. I was able to wear heels (about 3.75\") and it was just the right length. The built in bra was fantastic. It is fitted through the hip, which was great for me.

I needed a dress that stayed true to my age, body type, and style but was also conservative enough for a work event. I felt absolutely beautiful in this gown! It is not my usual first choice of color and style but I think it perfectly fit the profile of the evening. \nPRO's: I think the style and cut of the dress is flattering for every body type. There are ways around the low cut if you have a full bust; in my case I had to use 2 safety pins and some Hollywood tape to make sure that only the right amount of skin was showing. Normally, I would have probably used 1 safety pin and tape but I needed to remain a bit more conservative for this event. The length is as I expected it to be (everything is always long on me anyway). \nCON's: The only thing that I have to mention is for ladies like me, who have curvy hips. The slip on the dress stretches but is not relative to the chiffon overlay. So, in my case, I would have been a Size 4 were it not for the tightness of the slip. Even the 6 was a little snug. There is a stark contrast between the two layers of the dress, which may be deceiving for some when looking at pictures. The dress looks flowy but the slip will not be. I cannot really say anything negative about this dress, just a warning for fellow curvy girls.\nIn general, this was my first experience renting from RTR and I was very nervous because I am not a one size girl. I can vary from size 2-8 depending on the dress, designer, style, fabric, etc... I am 100% satisfied with the experience and will be renting again soon. THANKS RTR!!",

And the dress design did not disappoint - it looks great on, very comfortable and fits nicely at the top. It has a cute boatneck & deep back. The \"scuba\" type material is relatively lightweight.  It has a zipper so you don't have to squirm in or out. Unlike some other reviewers, this did not \"hug my curves\" - for me the lower half was too baggy - and looking at the model picture now, it looks like it was intended to come out away from the body below the waist.

A lot of reviews also talked about the clasp in the bust coming undone which I had pop open twice on the dance floor with some crazy moves, but other than that no issues with the clasp coming undone.  I feel though if I chose to wear the medium for a more fitted look, I would have had to pin that clasp like many others had done.

The torso on my size 14P was a tad too long, but the size 12P was just a little to tight to wear dancing all night.

The dress went perfectly with boots, tights, and a flowy cardigan (although I had to pin it behind or else it looked boxy over the poufy skirt). I am 5'5\" with a short torso and a relatively straight waist-hip ratio, and the flared skirt made me feel feminine. I usually wear a 4, and I thought that fit fine. Then I tried on the 2, which I ordered based on reviews saying to size down, and I liked how it gave a more defined shape. I wore the 2 for the ceremony but ended up changing into the 4 after a large meal. If this dress were available for sale, I wouldn't hesitate to buy it (in a size 4). If you have a tiny waist, you may be happy sizing down to the 2 or even 0. However, on me, my thicker waist made the waistline of the dress ride up higher and it didn't look good to size down too much. I also rented the version of this dress with the blue flowers, and they fit a bit differently. The arm holes of the blue were a tiny bit closer-set and showed my bra straps, and the fabric was thinner. This dress with the white and peach flowers had slightly thicker fabric and a more flared skirt. By the way, it is *not* neoprene like a wetsuit - it's more of a smooth ponte material.

I have a pretty small chest (32B), and you could have easily stuffed two padded bras in there - that's how much of a gap in the chest I was dealing with. The two straps in the back are not adjustable, so there was no way for me to make this fit. ALSO, this dress wears much more formal than pictures would have it appear.

I didn't think id end up wearing this one but when I put it on I knew. I was BLOWN AWAY by how gorgeous it was. The tags were even still on! It felt and looked very rich and very beautiful. It's a piece of art, truly. I felt so beautiful in it, more beautiful than I've ever felt! The photo on the website doesn't do it justice at all. The lace is actually gold with a lot of glittery shimmer to it, while the under layer is emerald, not the bluish it appears online. The lace is wonderful. Very delicate and breathtaking. I got a ridiculous amount of compliments from people I didn't even know at the wedding! The fit is great, with a very classic silhouette. It's also very light and breathable.  I did have to take smaller steps in it, and made my usual dancing a little difficult, but it was worth it! If you get the chance to rent this dress, you must! ",

In my opinion it looks a little better with a necklace, bracelet, and earrings. I wore this with white heels.

The length was better when I wore 3-inch heels (I am 5'5\"), but it worked alright with flats as well. Caution: wear with a slip! It was very windy for our rehearsal, and my dress was flying all over the place. People definitely saw my slip when the dress was blowing around, so if that is something that bothers you, don't wear this dress in the wind. I would recommend a slip regardless. \n\nLeave time for ironing\/steaming the dress, and if you can, use steam or get it pressed. It arrived wrinkled and I had a really hard time removing the wrinkles without steam. I have a short torso, so I felt like I had to keep an eye on how the dress was laying in that area.

The open back is really pretty and compliments the conservative front. Love the sheer shoulders and side panels. I am 5'6 and wore heels with it. It hits right above the knee... Perfect for a formal event. The bottom of the dress does not have a lot of give to it, so it is hard to bend down and pick things up or even put your shoes on once in it. I did wear a backless bra with it.\n\nGot compliments all night long (from ladies and gentlemen). Really a classy dress and perfect for a black tie optional, wedding, party, New Years, etc.",
